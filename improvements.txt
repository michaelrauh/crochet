# Crochet Project Improvement Steps

1. ✅ Create a shared package for Jaeger/OpenTelemetry initialization
   - All three services implement similar tracing setup code
   - Move initJaeger function to a common "telemetry" package

2. ✅ Standardize error handling across services
   - Implement common error types and handler functions
   - Created shared ServiceError type and error handling utilities in telemetry package

3. ✅ Extract HTTP client functionality to a shared package
   - Ingestor's callExternalService function could be reused by all services

4. ✅ Implement unified configuration management
   - All services have similar environment variable loading
   - Create a shared config package with typed configuration structs

5. ✅ Develop common health check implementation
   - Each service implements its own health check handler
   - Create a reusable health check middleware/handler

6. Create a shared logging package
   - Standardize log formats and levels across services
   - Add structured logging with context correlation IDs

7. Implement unified middleware handling
   - Move the ErrorHandler middleware to a common package
   - Add standard middleware for request logging, panic recovery, etc.

8. Extract service response/request types to a shared package
   - Many data types (like RemediationRequest) are defined in multiple services
   - Create common data models to ensure consistency

9. Implement a common service framework
   - Each service has similar setup patterns for HTTP handlers and server startup
   - Create a service framework to reduce boilerplate code

10. Add centralized metrics collection
    - Integrate with OpenTelemetry metrics alongside the existing tracing
    - Standardize metric names and collection methods across services

11. Add pyroscope to all services
    - Integrate pyroscope in to all services
    - ensure configuration is centralized and not duplicated across services

12. Make Context process additions to pairs and vocabulary in order
    - This can be slow and will only hold up ingestion
    - Make ingestion process in order too. In fact, context may not need to be updated if ingestion is updated
    - Aborting ingestion is OK but making it wait a little is better
    - Version checks should still be fast

13. Make Remediations thread safe
    - Write time consistency is not important, but read time consistency is very important
    - Do not worry about durability yet

15. Create an orthos server
    - It should have fast probabilistic checks and nonprobabalistic checks possible

16. Have ingestor call orthos 

14. Make sure remediations have referential integrity to orthos
    - If write to orthos fails, abort write to remediations 

16. Create a work server 
   
17. Work server should have queue semantics 
    - Back it with rabbitMQ and forward (n)ack 

18. Have ingestor call the work server 
    - Play remediations
    - Play an empty ortho 

19. Implement the worker server 
    - Implement call pattern
    - Implement search logic 

20. Make the services scalable 
    - Make sure storage backends can scale 
    - Make state durable 
    - Move to K8s 
    - Add a jump host
