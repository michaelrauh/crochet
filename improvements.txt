# Crochet Project Improvement Steps

1. Fix traces

9. Add centralized metrics collection
    - Integrate with OpenTelemetry metrics alongside the existing tracing
    - Standardize metric names and collection methods across services

10. Add pyroscope to all services
    - Integrate pyroscope in to all services
    - ensure configuration is centralized and not duplicated across services

11. Make Context process additions to pairs and vocabulary in order
    - This can be slow and will only hold up ingestion
    - Make ingestion process in order too. In fact, context may not need to be updated if ingestion is updated
    - Aborting ingestion is OK but making it wait a little is better
    - Version checks should still be fast

12. Make Remediations thread safe
    - Write time consistency is not important, but read time consistency is very important
    - Do not worry about durability yet

13. Create an orthos server
    - It should have fast probabilistic checks and nonprobabalistic checks possible

14. Have ingestor call orthos 

15. Make sure remediations have referential integrity to orthos
    - If write to orthos fails, abort write to remediations 

16. Create a work server 
   
17. Work server should have queue semantics 
    - Back it with rabbitMQ and forward (n)ack 

18. Have ingestor call the work server 
    - Play remediations
    - Play an empty ortho 

19. Implement the worker server 
    - Implement call pattern
    - Implement search logic 

20. Make the services scalable 
    - Make sure storage backends can scale 
    - Make state durable 
    - Move to K8s 
    - Add a jump host
