# Crochet Project Improvement Steps

4. Add ability to remove remediations 

5. Create a work server 
   
6. Work server should have queue semantics 

7. Have ingestor call the work server 
    - Play remediations
    - Play an empty ortho 

8. Implement the worker server 
    - Implement call pattern
    - Implement search logic 
    - implement metrics - start with queue depth, ortho count by size, queue count by size, average time to process by size, likelihood that there are hits by size, time remaining estimate, total found per input, number of input corpora, uptime, number of remediations
    - make positive the ingestor is properly handling remediations and jaeger picks up remediation and orthos calls

9. Make sure remediations have referential integrity to orthos
    - If write to orthos fails, abort write to remediations 

10. Make the services more scalable and durable
    - Make sure storage backends can scale 
    - Make state durable 
    - Move to K8s 
    - Add a jump host
