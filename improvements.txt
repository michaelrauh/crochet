# Crochet Project Improvement Steps

2. add version check endpoint to context

3. Create an orthos server
    - It should have fast probabilistic checks and nonprobabalistic checks possible

4. Have ingestor call orthos with remediation IDs to get the orthos back. Consider streaming or chunking to reduce memory overhead.

5. Create a work server 
   
6. Work server should have queue semantics 

7. Have ingestor call the work server 
    - Play remediations
    - Play an empty ortho 

8. Implement the worker server 
    - Implement call pattern
    - Implement search logic 
    - implement metrics - start with queue depth, ortho count by size, queue count by size, average time to process by size, likelihood that there are hits by size, time remaining estimate, total found per input, number of input corpora, uptime, number of remediations

9. Make sure remediations have referential integrity to orthos
    - If write to orthos fails, abort write to remediations 

10. Make the services more scalable and durable
    - Make sure storage backends can scale 
    - Make state durable 
    - Move to K8s 
    - Add a jump host
