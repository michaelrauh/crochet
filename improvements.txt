# Crochet Project Improvement Steps

1. Have ingestor call the work server 
    - Play an empty ortho 
    - delete remediations

2. Implement the search server 
    - Implement call pattern
    - Implement search logic 
    
3. implement metrics 
    - queue depth
    - ortho count by size
    - queue count by size
    - average time to process by size
    - likelihood that there are hits by size
    - likely total hits remaining
    - remaining time to ingest 
    - time remaining estimate
    - total found per input
    - number of input corpora
    - uptime
    - number of remediations

3. Make sure remediations have referential integrity to orthos
    - If write to orthos fails, abort write to remediations 

4. Make the services more scalable and durable
    - Make sure storage backends can scale 
    - Make state durable 
    - Move to K8s 
    - Add a jump host
